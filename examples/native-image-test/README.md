# Native Image Test Example

Test for native image rendering with TBM surface integration.

This demo demonstrates the basic functionality of rendering a single native image buffer.

It loads an external image file for native rendering, creates a TBM surface, and renders the image using custom shaders with proper texture mapping.

> Warning : This demo application works only for Tizen target.
