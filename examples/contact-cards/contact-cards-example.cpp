/**
 * @brief Creates several contact cards that animate between a folded and unfolded state.
 *
 * This demonstrates how different animations can start and stop at different times within the same Animation function.
 * Additionally, this also shows how to morph between two different geometries.
 *
 * ContactCardLayouter: This class is used to lay out the different contact cards on the screen.
 *                      This takes stage size into account but does not support relayouting.
 * ContactCard: This class represents each contact card on the screen.
 *              Two animations are set up in this class which animate several properties with multiple start and stop times.
 *              An overview of the two animations can be found in contact-card.cpp.
 * ContactCardLayoutInfo: This is a structure to store common layout information and is created by the ContactCardLayouter and used by each ContactCard.
 * ContactData: This namespace contains a table which has the contact information we use to populate the contact cards.
 * ClippedImage: This namespace provides a helper function which creates an ImageView which is added to a control that has clipping.
 *               This clipping comes in the form of a Circle or Quad.
 *               The Vertex shader mixes in the Circle and Quad geometry depending on the value of a uniform float.
 *               Animating this float between CIRCLE_GEOMETRY and QUAD_GEOMETRY is what enables the morphing between the two geometries.
 * MaskedImage: This namespace provides a helper function which creates an ImageView with a mask that matches the Circle geometry provided by ClippedImage.
 *              Using a mask yields much better quality than when using an image with a circle geometry, so this is ONLY used when the contact card is folded.
