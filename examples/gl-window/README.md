# GL Window Example

This is an example showing how to use a GL Window in DALi.

A GL Window allows injecting native drawing calls using GL API into the
DALi rendering pipeline so developers can execute custom code in a separate window.
This demo shows a bunch of cubes rendered by the custom GL code.

**Please note:** native-renderer.cpp/h are used from direct-rendering.example.
